# SQL-Challenge
 
This section I was able to complete with the help of fellow classmates, AskBCS, and online resources. I first created the ERD to map out which columns of the excel sheet will be the Primary and Foreign Keys, then I created the table, after the tables were created and the csv's were imported I worte the code to query it all.
